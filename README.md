## Sorting Algorithm & Big O Notation Project

Welcome to the Sorting Algorithm & Big O Notation project! This repository is dedicated to exploring various sorting algorithms and understanding their time complexities through the lens of Big O notation.

##Purpose
The primary goal of this project is to provide a comprehensive overview of sorting algorithms commonly used in computer science and analyze their efficiency in terms of time complexity. By implementing and comparing different sorting algorithms, we aim to deepen our understanding of algorithmic efficiency and the impact of algorithm choice on program performance.

##Contents
1. **Sorting Algorithms**: This directory contains implementations of popular sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and more.

2. **Big O Notation Analysis**: Here, you'll find discussions and analyses of the time complexities of each sorting algorithm, expressed using Big O notation.

##How to Use
Feel free to explore the code implementations and accompanying analyses. You can run the provided scripts to observe the algorithms in action and compare their performance.

##Contributions
Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to contribute improvements, additional sorting algorithms, or insights into Big O notation analysis, please fork the repository and submit a pull request.
